# Mobile Robotics USF

This repository is an extension of the project framework, [FAIRIS-Lite](https://github.com/biorobaw/FAIRIS-Lite), enabling users to implement navigational control logic for robots in the Webots simulation. It includes the necessary Python controller files that I have created for the various lab tasks required by this course.

The controller files are used to simulate robot motion and sensor readings in the Webots development environment. The free, open source Webots simulator can be found [here](https://cyberbotics.com/).

The controller files are the main deliverables for each lab and can be found in ```WebotsSim/controllers```. 

Each Lab will be explained in more detail in the following sections:

## Lab 1 - Kinematics

### Objective
The objective of this lab is to learn about motion control and kinematics for a robot to navigate through a set of waypoints.

<p align="center">The waypoints through the maze are displayed as follows:</p>

<em>Figure 1: Maze file with predefined waypoints the robot must navigate through</em>
</p>

To accomplish this task, required the use of several functions that make the robot perform straight-line, curved-line, and rotation motions. 
A full report with more information and calculations for this lab can be found in this 

Here is the corresponding Python controller for lab 1: [Lab 1 Controller](

The video below shows Lab 1 in action as the robot follows the waypoints described in Figure 1.
